SKB Base

Base definitions, some standard classes and services, categories for the SKB, and the base line for composite hierarchies for the SKB.


SKB Message
~~~~~~~~~~~
This message class contains information following the 5WH news style: 

* Who is it about?
* What happened?
* When did it take place?
* Where did it take place?
* Why did it happen?
* How did it happen?

In addition to that, the class also provides for information on the reporter (the object reporting the message) and
the message type (i.e. an error, a warning or an information).

The class comprises methods to build a message (+add*+, +set*+), methods to access a message (+get*+) and some additional
methods to process a complete message (+asST+, +render+, +toString+). Additionally, it carries an enumerate +EMessageType+ for typing messages.
Message properties that have a +set+ method (_reporter_, _type_, _when_, _where_, _who_) can only be set once and are immutable afterwards.
For message properties that have an +add+ method (_how_, _what_, _why_) information can be appended unlimited, but once added it cannot be removed.

The simplest way to create a message is to use the the builder methods. The following example creates a new message and sets all of its
properties:

---------------------------------------------------------------
Message5WH msg=new Message5WH()
	.setWho("from " + this.getClass().getSimpleName())
	.addWhat("showing a test message")
	.setWhen(null)
	.setWhere("the class API documentation", 0, 0)
	.addWhy("as a demo")
	.addHow("added to the class JavaDoc")
	.setReporter("The Author")
	.setType(EMessageType.INFO)
;
---------------------------------------------------------------

This message will print to the following lines:
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Author: info from Message5WHTests in the class API documentation >> showing a test message 
       ==> as a demo 
       ==> added to the class JavaDoc
---------------------------------------------------------------
